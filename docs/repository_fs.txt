1. Execution

   - Storage summary computation and History rollup are performed by Database Jobs. The jobs are scheduled to execute periodically using the DBMS_JOBS package. 
   - The storage summary computation job is single threaded and sequentially computes summary for each host target in the target master ( mgmt_targets ) .
     It computes the shared storage summary for the host and group storage summary for all host groups the host is part of.
   - The history rollup job rolls up the summaries computed by the storage summary job.

2. Computing storage summary for a target

   - Fetch the de-normalized metric sets for each of the following metrics from the current metrics table mgmt_current_metrics
     - Oracle Database metrics
     - Local filesystem metrics
     - NFS metrics
     - Volume metrics
     - Software Raid metrics
     - Disk metrics

   - Check for timestamp consistency
     - Metrics should be are later than the last computed summary for a host
     - All metrics should be of the same snapshot
   - Check for inode consistency
   - Check for disk partition consistency
   - Identify cached filesystems
   - Check for consistency across metrics.Generate identification key values for storage entities at each storage management level 
   ( disks, volume manager, software raid, Local filesystem , datafiles ).
     - Each higher level storage entity should be traceable to one at the lower level. ( disk metrics are the lowest level )

   - Identify backup disks ( Only EMC Symmetrix BCV disks ). Identify entities at each storage management level that use the backup disks.
   - All inconsistencies encountered during these checks are tracked and logged to the log table ( storage_log ).
   - Analyze and identify the used and free storage entities at each storage management level.
   - Compute the storage summary for the host.
      - Used and free storage for the host
      - Used and free at each storage management level.
      - Storage by vendor.   
   - Storage summary is a multi field single row data set ( summaryObject ).
   - Format the storage details for the host.
   - Storage details are multi field, multi row data sets.The data sets differ in structure for each storage management level.
   - Save the summary in the current summary table ( storage_summaryObject) , delete the previous summary for the host.
   - Save the details in the current details table , delete the previous details for the host.
     ( storage_application_table,
       storage_localfs_table,
       storage_nfs_table,
       storage_volume_table,
       storage_swraid_table,
       storage_disk_table )
   - Archive the summary in the archive table for history rollups ( storage_summaryObject_history )
   - Compute the shared summaries for hosts sharing storage with this host( 3.)
   - Compute the summaries for all host groups which this host is part of. ( 4.)


3. Computing shared summary
   - Delete all shared summaries for the host from the current summary table ( storage_summaryobject ).   
   - Get the list of hosts sharing disks with this host.
   - Identify the storage entities at each storage management level that use the shared disks.
   - Get the common storage entities at each storage management level 
   - Compute all combinations of shared hosts ( nC2+...+nCn)
   - For each combination of hosts compute a shared storage summary for only the shared storage between those hosts
   - Save each shared summary in the current summary table ( storage_summaryobject )
   - Insert the summary into the summary archive table for history rollups ( storage_summaryobject_history )


3. Compute group summary for reporting
   - Get the list of hosts for a host group
   - Compute group summary if the timestamp of storage summary for any host in the group is later than the timestamp of the previously computed group summary.
   - Filter the list of hosts to get only those hosts which have valid summaries and no consistency issues.
   - Aggregate the summary of all the filtered hosts in that group
   - Get the list of shared summaries for the filtered list of hosts.
   - Aggregate the shared summaries.
      - Shared summaries for a even combination of hosts get reduced
      - Shared summaries for a odd combination of hosts get added
   - Save the group summary in the current summary table ( storage_summaryObject) , delete the previous summary for the group.
   - Archive the group summary in the archive table for history rollups ( storage_summaryObject_history )


5. History Rollup
   - Fetch the archived summaries from the summary archive table  ( storage_summaryObject_history )
   - The start time for rolling up history is the lesser of last valid history point and the minimum timestamp in the summary archive table
   - The end time for rolling up history is the maximum timestamp in the summary archive table	   
   - Rollup all summaries between the start time and maximum time. Only a simple average is computed in history rollups.
     - Daily rollup ( storage_history_30days )
       - One point per day
      - Weekly rollup ( storage_history_52weeks )
	- One point per week    
    - For time points with no values , substitute the valid rolled up summary from the previous time point.
    - Insert the rolled up summaries into the daily and weekly history tables ( storage_history_30days,storage_history_52weeks ) 
    - For continuity , insert the most current summary into the rollup history tables.
    - Purge rolled up history beyond the rollup window cutoff point.
      - Daily rollup - 31 days
      - Weekly rollup - 53 Weeks
     - Purge the rolled up target summaries from the summary archive table

     - Correct rolled up group summaries
       - For all the hosts in the group definition , Get the count of the number of hosts with valid rolled up summaries.
       - Get this count for each rolled up point in the history tables
       - Compare the host count with the actual targets in the group summary for each rolled up point in the history tables.
       - If the host count is greater than the actual number of targets in the group summary,  re-compute the group summary from the rolled up host summaries for that point.


6. Maintaining host groups
   - Target master ( mgmt_targets )is refreshed periodically from multiple sources
   - The following reporting groups are maintained dynamically from target properties in the target_master ( mgmt_targets )
     - Location
     - Line of Business
     - Customer ??
   - Group master ( stormon_group_table, stormon_host_groups ) is updated each time the target master is refreshed
   - A new group is added in the group master when 
     - An existing group definition is altered 
     - A new group is created
