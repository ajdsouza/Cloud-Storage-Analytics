Metrics for Monitoring Storage


1	Introduction

	Metrics are collected for the following storage management layers.

	- Disk devices
	- Software Raid Manager
	- Volume Manager
	- Filesystems ( Local and networked )
	- Oracle RDBMS Server Application

	The collected metrics are analyzed in the repository to compute the storage summary.

2.	Disk devices

	The disk device metrics are instrumented for all disks entities mounted on the system. The disks entities are all
	    - Block and Character whole disks, 
	    - Block and Character disk partitions,
	    - Block and Character pseudo disks and 
	    - Block and Character pseudo disk partitions.
	
	A disk device will have 
	- One metric set instrumented for the whole physical disk.
	- A metric set for each block and character partition of the disk

	2.2 Metric Description

	 Metric Column				Description
	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	disk_devices_inode			Is a id to uniquely identify the disk device on the host. On UNIX based systems, a concatenation of the filesystem inode and the device inode uniquely identifies the device on the host.
	disk_devices_nameinstance		On UNIX based operating systems a disk can be identified by the disk driver name and the instance number eg. sd10 On Solaris
	disk_devices_logical_name		Is the name of the disk device on the operating system.
	disk_devices_filetype			Is the file type of the device being instrumented. It may be one of the following values
						- BLOCK for block devices
						- CHARACTER for character or raw devices.

	disk_devices_slice_key			Will uniquely identify a disk partition or slice across multiple hosts. Partitions of disks mounted on multiple hosts should have identical values for disk_devices_slice_key.
	disk_devices_type			Is the type of disk device or partition. It may have one of the following values
						- DISK for the whole disk and 
						- PARTITION for any disk partition.

	disk_devices_capacity			Is the storage capacity of the disk or the partition being instrumented. The value should be in bytes.
	
	disk_devices_disk_key			Uniquely identifies the physical disk device across multiple hosts. For a disk mounted on multiple systems the disk_devices_disk_key should have identical values. For most disks a disk key can be generated from the disk_devices_vendor , disk_devices_product and Vendor specific serial number for that disk.

	disk_devices_vendor			Is the vendor of the disk, for disks from external storage systems it is the vendor of the external storage system.
	disk_devices_product			Is the disk product, for disks from external storage systems it is the external storage system product.
	disk_devices_configuration		Is the hardware raid configuration of the disk device. 
	disk_devices_device_status		The status of the disk device. The device status field can have multiple values separated by the a space. The device status for a disk can be one or more of the following values
						-  OFFLINE for disks which are configured but not accessible.
						-  READY for disks which are configured and accessible.
						-  FORMATTED for formatted disks
						-  UNFORMATTED for unformatted disks
	
	disk_devices_storage_system_id		For an external storage system is a identifier for the external storage system. This id should uniquely identify the external storage system in a vendor family of products.
	disk_devices_storage_disk_device_id	Is the id of the disk device in the external storage system.
	disk_devices_storage_system_key		Is a universally unique id for a external storage system. It can be generated by appending the disk_devices_vendor , disk_devices_product and disk_devices_storage_system_id of a external storage system.
	disk_devices_storage_spindles		The location of the spindle in the external storage system. For a disk device carved out of multiple spindle ,disk_devices_storage_spindles can have multiple names separated by a coma.

	disk_devices_partitionstart		For a disk device or partition is the starting sector number of that disk device or partition.
	disk_devices_nsectors			For a disk device or partitions is the number of sectors in the disk device or partition being instrumented.
