BCVs
	Business Continuance Volumes are mirror copies of a disk that
	have their own lun.  The BCV can be split from its primary volume
	for a point-in-time image of the primary volume. 


LINUX
	Currently syminfo is not supported on typical linux installations.
	Syminfo requires the sg driver to be compiled into the kernel, making
	it difficult to deploy on a large number of machines.
